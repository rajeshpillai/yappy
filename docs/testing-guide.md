# 🧪 Yappy Test Suite Guide

I have implemented a comprehensive test suite using **Playwright** that covers all core features and logical groupings.

## 📁 Logical Groupings

### 1. Canvas & Basic Drawing
- **Shape Creation**: Tests creation of Rectangles, Circles, Diamonds, Text, and Lines.
- **Theme Sync**: Verifies Light/Dark mode toggling and state synchronization.
- **Grid Infrastructure**: Ensures grid settings (snap/size) are correctly applied.

### 2. Element Manipulation
- **Selection & Grouping**: Tests multi-element selection and Group/Ungroup functionality (`Ctrl+G`).
- **Clipboard Operations**: Verifies Copy/Paste/Duplicate mechanics.
- **History Management**: Ensures Undo/Redo works across deletions and modifications.

### 3. Property Management
- **Font Systems**: Tests switching between Virgil (Hand), Inter (Sans), and Monospace fonts.
- **Zen Mode**: Verifies UI panel visibility toggling (`Alt+\`).

### 4. Advanced Diagramming
- **Layer System**: Tests adding, activating, and managing multi-layers.
- **Smart Routing**: Verifies orthogonal elbow routing logic with obstacle avoidance.
- **Binding**: (Implicitly tested) ensures connectors maintain valid coordinates.

### 5. Persistence & UI State
- **Unified Dialogs**: Tests the combined Load/Save/Export experience.
- **Context Menus**: Verifies canvas-level interactions like Grid toggling.

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

Ensure the development server is running:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/comprehensive_features.spec.ts
```

View the visual report (if needed):
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
